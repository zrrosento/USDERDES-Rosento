				<h2>Activity 2: Favorite Application</h2>
				<p>Out of all the application that I’ve had in my phone my most favorite one would be the “Atmosphere”. Atmosphere is the perfect app to relax. 
					Just choose the sounds that you like and create your favorite combination, sleep, meditation, yoga, relieve stress, beat the anxiety and insomnia or just enjoy the sounds of nature. 
					It is an app created by the peak pocket studios. The app gives a free sound of an environment in every type of situation and even animal sounds. 
					What makes it so good is that it helps me to relax and calm my mind wherever I’m in stress. 
					It even has some short loop music in some instruments that is sounds so relaxing. 
					To use the application, you just must open it and choose what and which kind of sound or sound would you like to hear. 
					You could also adjust the sound that you are listening into simultaneously depending on what music or sound do you prioritize the most. 
					I’ve been using this application for an almost a year and I could say I always loved it and every music on it. Because it suits on every mood that I have. 
					The main features of it are probably the sounds that it can create, and you can listen to different sounds all at once depending on what sounds or music do you like.  </p>
			   
					<p>the 2nd Application that I really wanted the most. I’m a typical gamer who wants to play a lot of games in any type of devices that I usually carry with me. This game is like my go-to kind of game that I could play everywhere I want. This game is like playing a piano but instead you have the follow the beat that falls, and you have to press it whenever some beat launches. What makes this game so cool for me is that you don’t have to get stuck with the built-in songs that comes along with it. You could actually use the songs that you’ve downloaded in your phone and the game will automatically set it up for you to make it become part of the game. You could also adjust the game settings depends on how good you are such as it’s speed and how hard could it be. Because unlike any other rhythm games that I’ve played. They usually have songs but not all of them are my kind of taste in music. That’s what sets the Melobeats Different from any other rhythm application games.  </p>
					<p>The 3rd application that I also really like is a racing type of games. But not just an ordinary racing game. Because this game has the same vibe as Mario kart that you’d can pick up some items on the race that may help you win the race or may take you towards the advantage on the race. What I like the most in this application is its ability to play multiplayer online or offline. Which uses a split-screen mode. Which kind of gives back the old times vibes where you got to play with your friends with the same screen. What’s also cool about this game is that you could mount your wireless controller with the device that you’d installed it with. Then you could play the game without using any other 3rd party app to map the wireless controller. You literally just must connect the controller and play already. Also, if your device is capable enough of connecting to 4 people then you’d enjoy this game because you can play it with maximum of 4 people in the split screen mode which gives it a better experience than other multiplayer games. This game could also let you choose whether you wanted to play with A.I. or together with only your friends. For me what sets this game apart from other racing games aside from its multiplayer feature is the offline mode. Because you can still play it with or without the use of internet and you’d still enjoy it the same as it is in the online. What’s good for me about this game is that you could also adjust the graphic settings on it depending on what kind of capabilities your device can handle so you could enjoy the game with better experience and no lagging at all. </p>
