				<h2>Activity 6: Persona</h2>
				<p>Creating your own persona is a fun and intuitive way to shed more light on the purpose of your proposal. It gives your viewers a little taste of what your product or service is offering via characterizations of your population target.
				Generally speaking, personas are semi-fictional characters based on the traits or environment of your target population. This allows you to fine tune your presentation and gear it more towards your project’s goal. They are visual representations of how your proposal will be used, spread, or managed.
				In our group’s case, we’ve created three characters, each representing a target group for the reservation system. Three groups have been established, the Gaming Genesis members of APC, those working in the ITRO and casual gamer students.
				</p>
				<p>1.	Gaming genesis members
					<p>	•	Gaming Genesis is a small group in APC for those with a strong passion for games. Aside from spending time gaming casually, they also take it to the next level by facilitating events that promote the benefits of gaming, while also giving new students a taste of how fun APC can be.
					<p>	•	They are a target for the system because they also work as moderators of the Game Laboratory. They help newcomers find their place by signing in upon entry, while also taking careful note of the equipment and games in the lab. The system would help them survey the interactions between visitors and the equipment, while also ensuring that the room doesn’t get too crowded, or rowdy.
				</p>
				<p>2.	ITRO
					<p>	•	Aside from Gaming Genesis, the ITRO also plays an important role in the Game Laboratory. While the moderators watch over the interactions among members and equipment, ITRO officers also watch over peripheral equipment in the lab, ranging from TVs and Laptops to the internet connection that may soon be established. 
					<p>•	They would benefit most from the equipment liability aspect of the system, as they can now see who is using what in the room in the case of (god forbid) the loss and/or damage of property. In a general sense, it also allows them to survey the activities more closely by looking at previously-set schedules and making arrangements for professors when needed.
						
				</p>
				<p>3.	Casual gamers
					<p>•	As stated numerous times before, the Gaming Laboratory can get quite crowded, so it’s not uncommon to see groups of students waiting for a turn at the Xbox or PS4. Being an avid gaming community as a whole, many students in APC enjoy group gaming as a pastime, regardless of course or background. They would want to use their free time efficiently to enjoy a nice session with friends without any worries regarding schedules. </p>
					<p>•	The system would help these people reserve schedules in advance to make more accurate plans for a better experience in the room. This could also indirectly affect their performance with other classes or activities because it gives a more solid schedule for them to follow. They can easily find the time they need, before they actually need it.						</p>
